Disabling Godot Area2D `monitorable` or `monitoring` properties directly. The engine needs to disable these on its own time, instead use `SetDeferred("monitoring", false)`

If a namespace is not being recognized even though it is imported correctly in the `.csproj`. Launch Godot editor and your problem may go away just like that.
