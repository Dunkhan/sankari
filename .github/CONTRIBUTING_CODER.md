I am looking for C# programmers to help peer-review my code and expand on new gameplay mechanics like moving platforms, new enemies and player abilities.

If you need help understanding something, please just ask me on Discord (valk#9904) for help.

> ⚠️ Please talk to me whenever you want to work on something, this way I can tell you if others are working on it or if I do not want you to work on that specific thing right now.

### Exporting the Game
> ⚠️ Do not forget to put `enet.dll` beside the games exported executable or all multiplayer functions will not work

> ⚠️ To suppress the rcedit warning download [rcedit](https://github.com/electron/rcedit/releases) and link the executable to `Godot > Editor > Editor Settings > Export > Windows > Rcedit`
