I am looking for C# programmers to help peer-review my code and expand on new gameplay mechanics like moving platforms, new enemies and player abilities.

Project Setup
Read the setup guide for setting up Godot, VSCode and working with GitHub [here](https://github.com/GodotModules/GodotModulesCSharp/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) *(note that both these links are for another project called "Godot Modules" so ignore the part about the dev branch as this is not the case for this project)*

[formatting guidelines](https://github.com/GodotModules/GodotModulesCSharp/blob/main/.github/FORMATTING_GUIDELINES.md)
