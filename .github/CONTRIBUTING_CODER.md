### Exporting the Game
> ⚠️ Do not forget to put `enet.dll` beside the games exported executable or all multiplayer functions will not work

> ⚠️ To suppress the rcedit warning download [rcedit](https://github.com/electron/rcedit/releases) and link the executable to `Godot > Editor > Editor Settings > Export > Windows > Rcedit`
