## About
Sankari is a non-profit F2P 2D Platformer about a hero whose village gets raided and they go on a journey to free back the villagers that were captured and defeat the evil king. 

## Contributing
I am looking for C# programmers to help peer-review my code and expand on new gameplay mechanics like moving platforms, new enemies and player abilities. If this interests you send me a DM over Discord (valk#9904) or join the [Sankari Discord](https://discord.gg/5frafxrwwd) and send a message there.

### Formatting Guidelines / Project Setup
Please have a look at [formatting guidelines](https://github.com/GodotModules/GodotModulesCSharp/blob/main/.github/FORMATTING_GUIDELINES.md) and read the setup guide for setting up Godot, VSCode and working with GitHub [here](https://github.com/GodotModules/GodotModulesCSharp/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) *(note that both these links are for another project called "Godot Modules" so ignore the part about the dev branch as this is not the case for this project)*
