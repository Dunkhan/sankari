A better name for the game will be thought of later on.

Have a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/valkyrienyanko/super-mario-bros-like-game/issues/4).

Yes I know this looks like a crappy minecraft terraria mario spinoff. The minecraft / terraria feel will definitely go away in time but the mario feel will stay as that is what I was initially aiming for. I hope to make something very similar to mario but with a unique feel to it. Also this is my first time attempting a 2D side view platformer game.
