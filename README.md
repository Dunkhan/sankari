## Preamble
I am attempting to make a game with inspiration taken from Super Mario Bros (SNES). I do not want to copy the game pixel for pixel and I hope to make this game as unique as possible. A better name for the game will be thought of later on.

The roadmap can be found in the [Discord for the game here](https://discord.gg/5frafxrwwd)
