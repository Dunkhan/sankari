## Preamble
I am attempting to make a game with inspiration taken from Super Mario Bros (SNES). I do not want to copy the game pixel for pixel and I hope to make this game as unique as possible. A better name for the game will be thought of later on.

The roadmap can be found in the [Discord for the game here](https://discord.gg/5frafxrwwd)

## Contributing
Contact me on Discord (valk#9904) if you would like to contribute

### Contributing via coding
Please have a look at [formatting guidelines](https://github.com/GodotModules/GodotModulesCSharp/blob/main/.github/FORMATTING_GUIDELINES.md) and read the setup guide for setting up Godot, VSCode and working with GitHub [here](https://github.com/GodotModules/GodotModulesCSharp/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) *(but ignore the part about the dev branch as this is not the case for this project)*

### Contributing via art
All level tilemaps are 8x8 and the map is a 16x16 tilemap. Please cram all tiles in a nice grid like layout starting at the top left of the image. For animated tiles, save each frame in a separate file (`water_0.png`, `water_1.png`, `water_2.png`, ...)
